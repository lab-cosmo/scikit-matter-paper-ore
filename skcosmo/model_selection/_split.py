    Parameters
    ----------
    *arrays : sequence of indexables with same length / shape[0]
        Allowed inputs are lists, numpy arrays, scipy-sparse
        matrices or pandas dataframes.
    test_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the proportion
        of the dataset to include in the test split. If int, represents the
        absolute number of test samples. If None, the value is set to the
        complement of the train size. If ``train_size`` is also None, it will
        be set to 0.25.
    train_size : float or int, default=None
        If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
        proportion of the dataset to include in the train split. If
        int, represents the absolute number of train samples. If None,
        the value is automatically set to the complement of the test size.
    random_state : int or RandomState instance, default=None
        Controls the shuffling applied to the data before applying the split.
        Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
        See
        `random state glossary from sklearn (external link) <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#term-random-state>`_
    shuffle : bool, default=True
        Whether or not to shuffle the data before splitting. If shuffle=False
        then stratify must be None.
    stratify : array-like, default=None
        If not None, data is split in a stratified fashion, using this as
        the class labels.
    groups : array-like, default = None
        If not None, data is split keeping the groups together
    train_test_overlap : bool, default=False
        If True, and train and test set are both not None, the train and test
        set may overlap.

    Returns
    -------
    splitting : list, length=2 * len(arrays)
        List containing train-test split of inputs.
